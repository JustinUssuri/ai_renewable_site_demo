Code-writing guidelines (follow strictly):

1) Tackle one tiny step at a time, e.g.:
   - read & visualize a single raster,
   - or read one vector boundary file,
   - or do one simple raster clip.
2) Before any code, write 3–5 lines stating:
   - the goal of this tiny step,
   - the inputs,
   - the outputs.
3) Keep each code block ≤30 lines (excluding comments) and stick to 1–2 core libraries; avoid piling on dependencies.
4) Add comments on critical lines explaining what they do.
5) Afterward, recap the tiny step in 3–5 casual sentences.
